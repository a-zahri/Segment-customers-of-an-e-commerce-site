## Project display
Olist wants to provide its e-commerce teams with customer segmentation that they can use on a daily basis for their communication campaigns.

The goal is:
- to understand the different types of users through their behavior and personal data.

- to provide the marketing team with an actionable description of a segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a maintenance contract proposal based on an analysis of segment stability over the course of the time.
